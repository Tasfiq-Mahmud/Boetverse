# Boetverse

To run the robot model, you need to first source the package and then put this in terminal

**roslaunch boetverse urdf_visualize.launch**

After that, the gazebo gui as well as the controlling gui should appear and look like this

The robot is not much good. So it will move slow. I kept the movement less so that it doesnt fall :')
